# Proposed and current projects of d24n


d24n's mission is to promote and improve decentralizing technology. It does this in three ways: building community, educating the world on the tech, and funding relevant scientific research. 

## Community
We have funded one major community project:

* The [Silicon Valley Ethereum Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/EthereumSiliconValley/): d24n funds food, room rental, and other expenses of the meetup. This is the least costly project of any listed on this page.

## Education
We have made one significant grant for a university class:

* [University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) class](https://d24n.org/2022/01/25/grant-to-usp/): The foundation made a grant to Professor Marcos Antonio Simplicio Junior and USP for a technical credit-bearing course on blockchain and other decentralizing technologies to be offered at USP. An open version of the course will also be made available online to all, even those not enrolled at the university.

## Research
Though we are very happy to have funded the following research projcts, we are not accepting grant applications for further scientific research at this time:

* [Lighthouse Research](https://d24n.org/2021/05/13/lighthouse-research-report/): A grant to Sigma Prime funded development of the Lighthouse client and related scientific research.
* [An Economic Analysis of EIP-1559](https://d24n.org/2020/12/01/an-economic-analysis-of-eip-1559/) by Tim Roughgarden was very well received by the community. 
* [Ethereum Yellow Paper Improvements](https://d24n.org/2019/05/31/kestrel-institute/): A grant to the Kestrel Institute funded work on minor updates to the Ethereum Yellow Paper, which was the main specification for Ethereum 1.
